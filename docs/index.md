  Azure Confidential provider automates importing sensitive secrets, keys, and certificates from Terraform
  code into Azure services. To achieve the confidentiality, the sensitive materials are encrypted using RSA/AES encryption.
  Furthermore, the provider never logs or stores the plain text in state.
  A pre-requisite to using this provider is allocating a key vault containing a master RSA key (termed key-encryption key, or KEK)
  which  must be adequately protected. This guide https://github.com/aliakseiyanchuk/terraform-provider-az-confidential/blob/main/docs-templates/guides/setup.md
  offers a starting point how this can be achieved.
  The confidentiality of the encrypted data depends primarily on the tightness of controls to use decrypt the
  ciphertext using the designated key-encryption key. It is important to ensure that all necessary controls are 
  implemented during the initial implementation. Additionally, the practitioner may want to set up additional 
  alerts concerning unexpected actions (such as permission changes) to detect malfeasance or breaches.
  Authenticating Provider
  The preferred way of authenticating the provider is to set up the environment compatible with the
  azidentity.NewDefaultAzureCredential requirements. (You can read about this e.g. here https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/go/sdk/authentication/authentication-overview.)
  For local development, the provider supports client credentials authentication that needs to be
  provided to the provider e.g. via variables.
  To get started with testing this provider, the following configuration could be added to your project:
  
  provider "az-confidential" {
    tenant_id       = var.az_tenant_id
    subscription_id = var.az_subscription_id
    client_id       = var.az_client_id
    client_secret   = var.az_client_secret
  
    constraints         = ["demo", "test", "examples"]
    require_label_match = "provider-labels"
  
    default_destination_vault_name = var.az_default_vault_name
  
    default_wrapping_key = {
      vault_name = var.az_default_vault_name
      name       = var.az_default_wrapping_key
      version    = var.az_default_wrapping_key_version
    }
  }
  
  
  The required variables can be declared as follows:
  
  variable "az_tenant_id" {
    type = string
  }
  
  variable "az_subscription_id" {
    type = string
  }
  
  variable "az_client_id" {
    type = string
  }
  
  variable "az_client_secret" {
    type = string
  }
  
  variable "az_default_vault_name" {
    type = string
  }
  
  variable "az_default_wrapping_key" {
    type = string
  }
  
  variable "az_default_wrapping_key_version" {
    type = string
  }
  
  Primary Protection
  The ciphertext of the resources is protected by RSA cryptography. Only the people and processes granted the
  decrypt permission on the key-encryption key (KEK). It is a recommended practice to rotate KEK at periodic intervals
  and disable historic versions.
  Teh confidentiality of encrypted data is only as good as the controls around the KEK usage. Any person or process
  that technically is allowed to execute decrypt operation using this key would be able to decrypt and read
  the plain-text confidential data.
  Secondary Protection Measure
  In addition to tightening the access to KEK and rotating it periodically, the provider
  implements complimentary mechanism that prevent accidental cross-environment copying, intentional duplication
  and misuse. Where any secondary protection embedded into the ciphertext will no longer be satisfied,
  the Terraform plan/apply cycle will break. The Terraform practitioner is expected
  to obtain a re-encrypted ciphertext or delete the concerned Azure resource.
  Provider Constraints
  Provide constraints is a set of string labels is associated with a given provider instance in the Terraform project.
  An author of the ciphertext has an option to specify the labels they expect the provider should be configured
  with at the moment an encrypted message is created.
  A practical application of this technique is to guard against accidental copying of encrypted ciphertexts across
  projects intended for different regions and environments.
  Ciphertext Usage Tracking
  Ciphertext tracking is a feature which, as its name implies, tracks the use of the ciphertexts and allows each
  ciphertext to be unpacked the number of times the ciphertext author has allowed. I.e. if a resource is deleted and then
  added again, the second deployment
  could be rejected if the parameters embedded in the ciphertext prohibit this. Internally, this feature is based on
  UUID identifier that is cryptographically added to the ciphertext when it is created.
  The provider supports Azure Storage Account-base tracking which should be configured to track all ciphertext usages.
  This requires:
  creating a storage account (or designate any existing storage account);creating a table within that storage account;grant Storage Table Data Contributor role to the IAM account used by the provider.
  The configuration required for this could look e.g. as follows:
  
  provider "az-confidential" {
    # ... other configuration properties
  
    storage_account_tracker = {
      account_name = ".. an account name"
      table_name = ".. a table name"
      partition_name = ".. a partition name"
    }
  }
  
  Create time limiting
  It is recommended to add a limit the "shelf life" of a ciphertext before an Azure object is created using the
  confidential material the ciphertext carries. Typically, such window would be rather short, several hours or several
  days -- depending on the typical timeline between creating the ciphertext and initial deployment.
  Ciphertext expiry
  Next to limiting the creat time, a ciphertext can embed the requirement for the confidential material owner to re-encrypt
  the ciphertext periodically. This measure may be needed in certain context to ensure that the Terraform practitioner
  is actually in possession of the original confidential material. (In that respect, it is similar to re-authenticating an active user
  session periodically regardless of whether the user is still active.)
  As a best practice recommendation, a ciphertext should be re-encrypted at least yearly.
  Number of permitted usages
  The ciphertext can additionally constrain the number of times the ciphertext can be used, i.e. the number of times
  an Azure object could be created using the encrypted confidential material. This measure allows the ciphertext author
  to designate e.g. production object to be used once.
  When used in combination with create time limiting, this adds a secondary level of protection against accidental or
  deliberate copying.
