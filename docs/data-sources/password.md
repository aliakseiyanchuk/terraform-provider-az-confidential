# az-confidential_password (Data Source)

Datasource unwrapping (potentially very long) password into state

This resource is an illustration how to overcome the limitation of RSA encrypt
which cannot, on its own, encrypt a very large file.

The ciphertext should be obtained using the `tfgen` command-line tool
(see [source code](https://github.com/aliakseiyanchuk/terraform-provider-az-confidential).)
A typical command usage would be:
```shell
tfget -pubkey [path to the public key] \
	-fixed-labels demo,test \
	password
```

## Schema

### Required

- `content` (String) Encrypted secret value

### Optional

- `wrapping_key` (Attributes) Wrapping key to use for key and secret unwrapping purposes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--wrapping_key))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Identifier of the decryption operation
- `plaintext_password` (String) Decrypted password
- `plaintext_password_b64` (String) Base64-encoded plaintext password (where the password is a byte sequence)
- `plaintext_password_hex` (String) Hex-encoded plaintext password (where the password is a byte sequence)

### Nested Schema for `wrapping_key`

Optional:

- `algorithm` (String) Algorithm to unwrap the secret/content encryption key material
- `name` (String) Name of the wrapping key
- `vault_name` (String) Vault name containing the wrapping key
- `version` (String) Version of the wrapping key to use for unwrapping operations
